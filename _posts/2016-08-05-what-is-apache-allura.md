##About Allura

Apache Allura is a Top-Level Project under the Apache Software Foundation since April of 2014. 
It powers SourceForge, Open Source Projects Europe, DLR German Aerospace Center and DARPA's VehicleForge.  

The most interesting features that distinguish Apache Allura from currently trending Forge Software like GitHub, GitLab and
the Atlassian Toolkit are
it's modularity and use of well-known python technologies. It is one of the easiest to set up for personal or professional use
and even for use by big organisations. It reaches millions of users and developers throught the ~500,000 projects hosted
on SourceForge. 

With having minimal steps in setting up your own instance of Apache Allura on a DigitalOcean droplet, a RaspberryPi, or simply
using SourceForge.net it is
one of the most valueable products that you can deploy for your team for collaborating on code, 
documentation, research, or even blogging, chatting, discussing or even maintaining your personal Wiki. It is very convenient for new 
users to setup in terms of usablity by using the defaults and also provides enough tools, settings, access control and ways to modify your Forge 
for powerusers.

This week, I will be posting a series of posts about Allura. So stay tuned!
